# Tetris AI

Final project for the Building AI course


## Summary

My project is about a simple tetris videogame, however the play is implemented with AI. The AI will use reinforcement learning(RL) by rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
My idea is going to try to solve winning Tetris and perfecting playing Tetris. This problem is not common, but the end result will be interesting. My motivation: I like videogames and I would like to try out this small simple project as a starter.


## How is it used?

The solution will be used only by people, who are interested in this kind of thing or users, who would like to create their own similar project and are looking for where to start and how a finished project should look like.


## Data sources and AI methods

I won't need any dataset as the AI learning method will be RL.


## Challenges

The limitation is the frame of the game itself. Once the AI has perfected itself, it won't have any other use other than playing Tetris.

## What next?

The next thing I would like to try (implementing AI) would be a larger project, which actually targets real world problems.


## Acknowledgments

My sources of inspiration are videogames and interest in AI.
